# godot-3D-UI
An approach to an inventory that uses 3D models instead of icons!
Keep in mind, this project uses C# and was last tested on Godot 4.3

In this approach, items use a 3D model that reacts to mouse hover as well as mouse position for a juicy effect.
They can also be dragged into different slots, and react to being dragged as well.
